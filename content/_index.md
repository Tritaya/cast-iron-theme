  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - question: "How do I season my cast iron cookware?"
      answer: "To season your cast iron, clean it thoroughly, apply a thin layer of oil, and bake it in the oven at 450°F for 1 hour. Repeat this process 3-4 times for the best results."
    - question: "Can I use soap to clean my cast iron?"
      answer: "While it's best to avoid soap for routine cleaning, a little mild soap is okay for tough messes. Just be sure to re-season your pan afterward."
    - question: "How do I remove rust from my cast iron?"
      answer: "To remove rust, scrub the affected area with steel wool, rinse, dry thoroughly, and re-season the pan immediately."
    - question: "Can I use metal utensils with my cast iron cookware?"
      answer: "Yes, you can use metal utensils with cast iron. The seasoning is resilient, but be gentle to avoid scratching the surface."
