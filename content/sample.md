## Tradingview Events Which Are To Influence BTC Price

US Economic Data Releases
-------------------------

The cryptocurrency market is closely monitoring upcoming US economic data, which could significantly impact Bitcoin's price:

*   **ISM Manufacturing Data** (Tuesday): Will provide insights into the industrial sector's health
*   **JOLTs Report and Factory Orders** (Wednesday): Offer an overview of the labor market and manufacturing strength
*   **Jobless Claims, Challenger Job Cuts, and ISM Services** (Thursday): Set the stage for Friday's crucial report
*   **Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) Report** (Friday): Expected to be the major market mover

The unemployment rate, average hourly wages, and labor force participation rate will be closely watched for any deviations from forecasts.

Consumer Price Index (CPI)
--------------------------

The August Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Wednesday, September 11 is a critical event. Economists expect inflation to drop to 2.7%, down from July's 2.9%. If realized, this could strengthen Bitcoin's position.

Consumer Sentiment Report
-------------------------

The preliminary consumer sentiment report, set for release on September 13, will highlight the gap between overall US economic strength and households' perception of their financial well-being.

Trump-Harris Debate
-------------------

The upcoming presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris has put crypto in the spotlight. Both candidates have made cryptocurrency a central topic in their campaigns, and the debate's outcome could influence market sentiment.

Bitcoin Halving Impact
----------------------

While the influence of the 2024 Bitcoin halving on BTC's price has diminished, it remains a factor to consider. The demand from long-term and large-scale investors has become a significant driver pushing Bitcoin's price upward.

Historical September Performance
--------------------------------

Historically, September has been the worst month for Bitcoin prices. So far in 2024, this trend has continued, with Bitcoin down nearly 7% since the start of September. However, the upcoming US economic events and political developments could potentially reverse this trend.

Market Volatility
-----------------

Bitcoin's 30-day historical volatility has surged to 70%, indicating potentially dramatic price movements. Additionally, short-term options expiries have seen a sharp increase in implied volatility, suggesting heightened market stress.

These events and indicators collectively paint a picture of potential volatility for Bitcoin in the coming weeks. Traders and investors should closely monitor these factors as they navigate the cryptocurrency market.

## How Might The Trump-harris Debate Influence Bitcoin's Price

Here are a few key points about how the Trump-Harris debate could potentially influence Bitcoin's price:

1.  The debate itself is not expected to focus heavily on cryptocurrency issues. Polls suggest crypto is not a top priority for most voters compared to issues like the economy, inflation, and immigration.
2.  However, any statements made about crypto could still impact market sentiment:

*   Trump has recently embraced a pro-crypto stance, promising to make the US a "crypto hub" if elected. A strong performance by Trump could be seen as bullish for crypto.
*   Harris's position is less clear, though she has engaged with some crypto industry leaders. Her stance during the debate could sway sentiment either way.

3.  The debate outcome could influence broader economic expectations, which indirectly impact crypto:

*   Trump is seen as more likely to cut taxes and regulations, which some analysts believe could boost Bitcoin's price.
*   A Harris win is viewed by some as potentially leading to stricter crypto regulations.

4.  Short-term volatility is expected around the debate and other upcoming economic events:

*   Bitcoin's 30-day historical volatility has increased to 70%.
*   Short-term options show rising implied volatility, suggesting traders anticipate price swings.

5.  The debate is just one factor among many influencing crypto prices currently, including:

*   Speculation about potential Fed interest rate cuts
*   The upcoming US CPI data release
*   General election uncertainty

6.  While the debate could cause short-term price movements, most analysts don't expect crypto policy to be a deciding factor in the overall election outcome.

In summary, while the debate itself may not focus heavily on crypto, it could still influence Bitcoin's price in the short-term through its impact on overall market sentiment and economic expectations. Traders appear to be positioning for increased volatility around this and other upcoming events.
