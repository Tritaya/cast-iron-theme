Cast iron cookware is known for its durability and longevity, but proper care and maintenance are crucial to keep it in top condition. Here are some tips to help you maintain your cast iron cookware:

## Cleaning

1. **Clean while still warm**: After cooking, let the pan cool slightly and then rinse it with hot water.
2. **Use a brush or scraper**: For stuck-on food, use a stiff brush or a pan scraper. Avoid using soap as it can strip the seasoning.
3. **Dry thoroughly**: After cleaning, dry your cast iron piece completely with a clean cloth or paper towel.

## Seasoning

Seasoning is the process of baking oil into the iron, creating a natural, non-stick surface.

1. **Apply a thin layer of oil**: Use a paper towel to apply a thin layer of vegetable oil or melted shortening to the entire surface of the cookware.
2. **Bake it**: Place the oiled cookware upside down in an oven preheated to 450-500°F (230-260°C). Bake for about an hour.
3. **Let it cool**: Turn off the oven and let the cookware cool completely before removing it.

## Storage

1. **Store in a dry place**: To prevent rust, always store your cast iron in a dry place.
2. **Stack carefully**: If stacking, place a paper towel between pieces to protect the seasoning.

By following these care instructions, your cast iron cookware will continue to improve with age and use, becoming a cherished kitchen heirloom.
